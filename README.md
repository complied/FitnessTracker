Fitness Tracker  

# Overview  
A simple C++ program that helps users log workouts, get workout recommendations, and calculate calories burned based on activity type.  

#Features  
- Log workout type and duration  
- Get basic workout recommendations  
- Calculate total calories burned  
- Workout Assign


V - 0.1 - 
+ Added a Display function with error handling.
+ Proper display with <iomanip> library implementation!

v - 0.2 - 
+ New Feature: Added a Calorie Calculator, which allows users to estimate calories burned based on their weight, workout type, and duration.
+ Supports three workout types: Running, Swimming, and Biking.
+ Implements error handling for invalid inputs, prompting users to enter the correct workout name.
+ Uses MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) values for accurate calorie estimation:
    + Running (~6 mph): MET = 9.8
    + Swimming (moderate effort): MET = 7.0
    + Biking (~12-14 mph): MET = 8.0
+ Outputs calculated calories burned in a formatted, user-friendly manner with two decimal precision.
+ Updated Menu function! - Better flexiblity

v - 0.3 - 

+ Implemented New Features for #CalorieChecker!
   + Used cin.fail(), cin.ignore(), and numeric_limits to improve input validation.  
   + Ensures only valid inputs are accepted, preventing bugs and crashes.  

+Removed Fitness.cpp/Fitness.hpp files
   + Organized all functions into their own .cpp and .hpp files for better structure and maintainability.  

+ New Function Added! #WorkoutRecommendation
   + Recommends workouts based on different fitness levels:  
      + Beginner- 3-day workout plan  
      + Moderate - 4-day workout plan  
      + Intermediate - 6-day workout plan  

v - 0.4 -- 

+ Created A New Function! #WorkoutLogger! Uses the parameeters of string[], int[] 
+ Added a configuration for how many workouts you can log - In this case 15
    + Uses arrays to store workout activities and durations 
+ Using If to check y for yes more & n for no more logging 

+ Security 
    + Added std::numeric_limits<streamsize>::max() to clear input buffer and prevent skipping issues.
        + Usuage of cin.ignore and getline to avoid invalid duration inputs

+ Updated Code for Workout Reccomendation! 
    + Now the security bug got fixed
    + Added a while-loop to ensure valid input selection before proceeding.
        Users can no longer enter invalid options like and proceed.
    +C learer formatting for invalid input messages.
    + Prevents accidental exits due to incorrect input.
    

+ Updated Main! 
    + Now added a loop in main where, Now It wont end Untill user presses Enter or return - Bascially White Space 
    + Now Theres Another Switch statement added - 4 To exit! 
    + Loops and Loops now! 
    + added extra Cin command cin.get(); & cin.fail();

v - 0.5.5 -- 

+ Implemented AssignWorkoutDay function 
    + - Connects with workoutLogger by accessing the existing global arrays (activities, durations, and workoutCount).
        - Passes these arrays as parameters into assignWorkoutToDay()
        - Goes through the workouts, creates shared pointers, and assigns them to days inside a map<string, vector<shared_ptr<workout>>>.
        - Added 5 times a week limitations for reccomendations. 
        
    + White space bug fixed
        - Missing break statement in main , Case 4 fixed. 
        - cin.ignore() being called before every getline() caused white space/enter issue - > next workout being skipped. 
        - Replaced it with cin.ignore() every time workoutcount == 0.
